# Ohuhu Palette Generator 🎨

The [Ohuhu Palette Generator](https://mysticsparklewings.github.io/OhuhuPaletteGenerator/) is a tool designed to help artists and colorists create random color palettes using Ohuhu markers.
Palettes of 3–8 colors can be generated from the **Honolulu**, **Oahu**, and/or **Kaala** marker lines, or a combination of the three.

## 📝 Notes 📝

- Using the "Similar Colors" filter for the Kaala marker line may generate palettes of only 1-2 colors. This is because the Kaala line only consists of 150 colors, so there are fewer total "Similar Colors" to pick from.
- The Hex Codes used by this generator may not be exact and exist purely to give a general idea of what each color looks like. Always test your color palettes with real marker swatches first for best results!
- The Hex Codes may be updated and/or changed in the future for better color accuracy
- The code for this project has been heavily Frankensteined from existing color palette generator projects and therefore is probably not as elegant as it could be.

## ✨ Acknowledgments ✨

- I do not own or work for the Ohuhu brand, nor do I own any associted branding, marks, etc. I just like using the markers!

- This project would not exist if it were not for both the requests and generosity of the wider Ohuhu Community, so Thank You!
